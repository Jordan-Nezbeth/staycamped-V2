<p>StayCamped bridges the gap between people who want the camping experience and owners who want to make their investment pay off. Founded by Jordan Nezbeth, who grew up immersed in his family’s camper dealership, StayCamped was built to solve a real problem.</p>
<p>Many people want to camp without committing to big upfront costs. At the same time, camper owners often worry they won’t use theirs enough to justify the payment. StayCamped changes that — offering RVs already set up at great campsites, ready when you are. It's camping made simple, smart, and sustainable.</p>
